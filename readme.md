#Flare Config

I personally am not a huge fan of how complicated the Symfony PHP framework is, but I am a fan of how it allows you to have config files in either PHP, XML or yAML format.

Soemtimes writing yAML or XML makes more sense and is definitely cleaner than writing $config['itemname'] all of the time.

Sure loading config files other than the standard way will have a little overheard for the yAML or XML parsing, but very minimal at that.

##Using Flare Config
The library is not complete just yet. It won't be complex and you will still use the same $this->load->config format to load your files.

More will be explained later.
